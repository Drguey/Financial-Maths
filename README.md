# Financial-Maths
The aim of this project is to showcase financial maths concepts that I have learned in my university studies, creating functions in python which demonstrate these concepts.  The overall aim is to create a GUI financial calculator using Tkinter which calls upon these functions, allowing user input to compute various calculations.

-Interest Rate Conversion Function (Takes a nominal annual rate and number of compounding period as inputs and calculates the effective annual rate)

-Discount Rate Scraper (Finds an appropriate discount rate through web scraping; Takes the current 10 year Australian yield rate and compares it to the current RBA Cash rate, taking the maximum of the two as a conservative figure)

-Ordinary Annuity Function (Calculates the Present Value and Future Value of an ordinary annuity given the appropriate inputs)

-Annuity Due Function (Calculates the Present Value and Future Value of an annuity due given the appropriate inputs)

-Console Function (Calculates the Price of a Consolidated Stock given the appropriate inputs)

-Zero Coupon Bond Function (Calculates the Price of a Zero Coupon Bond given the appropriate inputs)
